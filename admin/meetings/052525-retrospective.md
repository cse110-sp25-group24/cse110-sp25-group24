## ðŸ“Š Retrospective Activities

## ðŸ“ˆ **Metrics**

- **Return on Time Invested (ROTI):**
  - Average: 3.91 / 5
  - Ratings: 11

## ðŸ”‘ **Key Takeaways**

1. **Process Improvements:**
   - Address standup engagement: Explore alternative formats (e.g., Slack updates for daily check-ins) if live standups are not consistently effective, while ensuring important discussions still occur.
   - Reinforce meeting punctuality and agenda adherence to respect everyone's time.
   - Improve feature scoping and prioritization for sprints to ensure realistic goals and maintain momentum.
2. **Technical Adjustments:**
   - Develop and enforce unified CSS styling guidelines to improve UI consistency and reduce integration friction.
   - Continue standardizing development tools (e.g., Prettier) and documenting key technical patterns (e.g., asynchronous handling).
3. **Collaboration:**
   - Emphasize the importance of timely responses on communication platforms (especially Slack) to avoid blocking teammates.
   - Maintain regular, well-attended meetings to facilitate communication, resolve blockers, and keep everyone aligned.

## ðŸš€ **Next Sprint Focus**

- **Priority 1:** Deliver a functional end-to-end version of the website, focusing on completing core user flows (e.g., create memory, view memories, login).
- **Priority 2:** Achieve UI and CSS consistency across all integrated pages and components.
- **Priority 3:** Continue development of key supporting features such as the offline map fallback solution and stress-testing image upload functionality, once the core flows and UI are stable.

**Next Retrospective:** 5/31/2025

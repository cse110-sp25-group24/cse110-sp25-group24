## 🧠 Agenda

- Discuss final sprint/week objectives
- Designate tasks to all team members
- split up backend work equally among all group members
- Check up on health of everyone and where we're at!

## 📌 Key Discussion Points

- Form safety checks for code.
- Discuss page fallback method for things that break in case. 
- Discuss the idea/use of restricted api key.
- Brought up topic of more testing/E2E hookup, especially as coding comes to a close. 
- Fix css - > refactor w/ styling  and potentially help refactor html semantics (for actual html tags that i might not have known ab).
- Come up with justification/rejection reasons for babel (do we necessarily need for integration/e2e testing? does this necessarily make our lives a whole lot easier?) 
  May not be necessary/needed!
- Figure out a way to edit cards.

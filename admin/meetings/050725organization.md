## üó£Ô∏è TA Meeting Highlights (Scrum Guidelines)

- Use GitHub Projects to manage product and sprint backlogs
- Maintain weekly sprint cycle:
  - **Sprint Planning:** Assign issues from backlog
  - **Sprint Standups:** Daily check-ins (in person or async)
  - **Sprint Review:** Show progress and demo (recorded)
  - **Sprint Retrospective:** Discuss what went well/wrong (recorded)
- Create issues for all known deliverables now, even if they won‚Äôt be built yet
- Gradually create new ADRs after each sprint milestone

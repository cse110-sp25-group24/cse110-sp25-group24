# Team Charter

> **Purpose:** This team charter serves to align our group on shared goals, expectations, and workflows throughout the software development lifecycle. It establishes a foundation for accountability, collaboration, and communication as we work together to build a high-quality, well-documented project that reflects industry-standard practices. By defining our values, roles, and processes early, we aim to ensure an efficient, respectful, and growth-oriented team environment.

## 1. Objectives

- Create a clean, polished project that demonstrates strong software engineering principles

- Learn desirable coding practices such as creating documentation and following coding standards to improve future career prospects

- Collaborate in a large team setting to become familiar with industry practices

- Learn how to utilize GitHub through the Agile development process--setting up GitHub issues, establishing a workflow, making pull requests and branches, etc.

- Learn and improve our web development with HTML, CSS, and JS so that we can apply it to personal projects

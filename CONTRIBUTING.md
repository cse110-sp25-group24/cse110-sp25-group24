# How to make changes to this repo

1. MAKE SURE YOU FIRST MAKE A NEW BRANCH LIKE `your_github_username-issue#`
2. MAKE A NEW HTML/CSS FILE (if your issue does not have template files already) FOR YOUR WORK UNDER THE `source/` FOLDER
3. When you are done with making all your commits and are ready to push to the remote, do this command:

   ```bash
   git push origin HEAD:your_current_branch_name
   ```

4. Then make a PR and fill out the template.
5. Happy Coding :)
